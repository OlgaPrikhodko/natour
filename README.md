This is a fun practice project where I built a responsive and lively landing page for a make-believe company that organizes nature tours. The website is really active with lots of moving parts like animated buttons and cards. There's a hero section with a beautiful background picture, and a feedback section that has a video playing in the background. It also features a navigation bar that stays in place as you scroll.
